# Feature fusion using Discriminant Correlation Analysis (DCA)

Feature fusion is the process of combining two feature vectors to obtain a single feature vector, which is more discriminative than any of the input feature vectors. 
DCAFUSE applies feature level fusion using a method based on Discriminant Correlation Analysis (DCA). It gets the train and test data matrices from two modalities X and Y, along with their corresponding class labels and consolidates them into a single feature set Z.
